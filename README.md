# NLP_extract_text_from_PDF
Extract text from two files and prepare a translation dataset by comparing text from two pdfâ€™s as both the files have same content in different languages.

## extract_data
Each data extracted from the PDF has attributes such as language, page number, index of the text block on the current page, and coordinates of the text block.

Users can prepare translation datasets required for model training by comparing the page numbers and coordinates of text blocks extracted from two PDFs for bilingual text alignment.
